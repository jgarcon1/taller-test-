# Mapping Paris

*[A Penn Libraries Digital Scholarship Project](https://guides.library.upenn.edu/digital-scholarship)*

Mapping Paris is an Omeka Theme designed to showcase Neatline Exhibits. Any Neatline exhibits are featured on the home page and link directly to their fullscreen views. It also adds a variety of additional features to how Neatline exhibits are displayed:
* Narrative & pop-up windows are combined and locked to side of map
* Images in pop-ups can be opened in a lightbox
* Records can be filtered using tags

Note! This theme does not play well with Neatline Text and Simile Timeline. The locked pop-up will overlap with these widgets.
